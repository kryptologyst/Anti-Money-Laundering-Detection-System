Project 493: Anti-Money Laundering System
Description:
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems are designed to detect suspicious financial transactions that may indicate money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit activities. In this project, we simulate an AML detection system that identifies suspicious transactions based on patterns such as transaction size, frequency, and location.

🧪 Python Implementation (AML Detection with Decision Tree)
For real-world systems:

Integrate with transaction databases or real-time monitoring systems.

Use datasets such as synthetic AML datasets or Kaggle’s Financial Transaction Datasets.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
 
# 1. Simulate financial transaction data
np.random.seed(42)
data = {
    'transaction_amount': np.random.normal(5000, 2000, 1000),  # USD
    'transaction_frequency': np.random.randint(1, 10, 1000),  # number of transactions per day
    'customer_age': np.random.randint(18, 70, 1000),
    'transaction_location': np.random.choice(['Domestic', 'International'], 1000),
    'previous_suspicious_activity': np.random.choice([0, 1], 1000),  # 0 = no, 1 = yes
    'is_suspicious': np.random.choice([0, 1], 1000)  # 0 = no, 1 = suspicious
}
 
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
 
# 2. Preprocessing
df['transaction_location'] = df['transaction_location'].map({'Domestic': 0, 'International': 1})
X = df.drop('is_suspicious', axis=1)
y = df['is_suspicious']
 
# 3. Scaling numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X[['transaction_amount', 'transaction_frequency', 'customer_age']])
 
# 4. Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
 
# 5. Decision Tree model for detection
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
 
# 6. Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("AML Detection Model Report:\n")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
 
# 7. Predict suspicious activity for a new transaction
new_transaction = np.array([[7000, 8, 45, 1, 1]])  # Example: high transaction amount, frequent international transactions, previous suspicious activity
new_transaction_scaled = scaler.transform(new_transaction)
predicted_suspicious = model.predict(new_transaction_scaled)
print(f"\nPredicted Suspicious Activity: {'Suspicious' if predicted_suspicious[0] == 1 else 'Not Suspicious'}")
✅ What It Does:
Simulates transaction data with features like transaction amount, frequency, customer age, location, and previous suspicious activity.

Uses a Decision Tree Classifier to detect suspicious transactions (potential money laundering).

Evaluates model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Predicts if a new transaction is suspicious based on the model.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Use real-world financial data to improve the accuracy of the model.

Add more features like geolocation of transactions, transaction patterns, or relationship networks between customers.

Model improvement: Implement more sophisticated models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks for more robust detection.
